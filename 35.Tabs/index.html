                    HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and design webpages and web
                    applications. It
                    forms the backbone of all web content, defining the structure and layout of a webpage by using a
                    variety of elements
                    (tags) that describe the content to be displayed by a web browser.

                <h1>CSS</h1>
                <p>
                    CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a
                    document written in HTML or
                    XML. CSS is responsible for the look and feel of a webpage, allowing you to control layout, colors,
                    fonts, spacing, and
                    overall visual design, independent of the content.

                <p>
                    JavaScript (JS) is a high-level, dynamic programming language that is primarily used to create
                    interactive and dynamic
                    content on websites. It is one of the core technologies of the web, alongside HTML and CSS, and is
                    widely used for both
                    client-side (in the browser) and server-side (e.g., with Node.js) development.

                <p>
                    React.js, often referred to simply as React, is a popular open-source JavaScript library used for
                    building user
                    interfaces, particularly for single-page applications where data dynamically changes over time. It
                    was developed by
                    Facebook and is maintained by Facebook and a community of developers.

                <p>
                    Vue.js, commonly referred to as Vue, is an open-source JavaScript framework used for building user
                    interfaces and
                    single-page applications (SPAs). It was created by Evan You and has gained popularity due to its
                    simplicity,
                    flexibility, and ease of integration with other projects.
